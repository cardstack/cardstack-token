## Smart Contracts

### CardStack Token Smart Contract
The CardStack Token smart contract governs the issuance, purchase, and selling of CardStack Tokens (CST) and is owned by the CardStack Foundation. This contract has the ability to create mulitple instances of the CardSTack Attribution Smart Contract which governs specific CardStack applications.

### CardStack Attribution Smart Contract
The CardStack Attribution smart contract is used to collect CST rewards and disseminate the CST rewards based on attribution signals for a specific CardStack project. A CardStack Attribution smart contract is instantiated from the CardStack Token contract by the CardStack application owner. CardStack users can exchange their CST for Software and Services Credits (SSC) with a CardStack Attribution smart contract that governs a particular CardStack application. The CST collected from the CardStack Attribution contract is then added to a reward pool. The reward pool is disbursed amongst the contributors of the CardStack application for which the CardStack Attribution contract was created. The reward pool disbursements are based on attribution signals collected by a CardStack attribution oracle.

A CardStack user may also use SSC purchased from the Software and Services Credit smart contract in order to exchange the SSC for actual sofware and services performed to maintain the CardStack application governed by the CardStack Attribution smart contract.

### Software and Services Credit Smart Contract
The Software and Services Credit smart contracts is governs the issuance, purchase, and selling of Software and Services Credits (SSC). Software and Services Credits are non transferable credits that are pegged to the USD. SSC can be used with a CardStack Attribution Smart Contract to exchange for software and services for a CardStack application that the Attribution contract governs.
