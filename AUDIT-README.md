In preparation for the CST ICO, this document describes pertinent information for auditing of the CST ERC-20 token.

## Overview

The CST ERC-20 token is inspired bt the "Colony" approach for composing our contracts (https://blog.colony.io/writing-upgradeable-contracts-in-solidity-6743f0eecc88). Specifically, in order to have a token that can be upgradable with the minimum expedenditure of gas, we have separated our contract data from the contract functionality. The idea that the CST ledger itself is a spearate entity from the ERC-20 contract. This approach, we feel, gives us the maximum amount of flexibility to leverage different types of token sales that all operate upon the same ledger, as well as being able to upgrade our contracts without having to worry about gas fees for migrating ledger state into a new version of the contract.

In our contract design, we have extended the "colony" approach by also providing a "registry" contract. The idea is that we can register "named" storage, and "named" contracts with the registry. The registry keeps track of the `name => address` mapping for storage and for token contracts. When a contract is created, it is created with the name of the storage that it requires, e.g. `cstLedger` or `cstStorage`. The contract is then "registered" with the registry, and given a name itself. This registration action will associate the storage that the contract requires to a specific address of the registered CstLedger contract. Additionally, the contract being registered will be mapped to a name. When a new version of the contract is created, we can invoke an `upgrade()` function on the registry with the new version of a particular contract name. The Registry will then reassign the existing storage of the old contract to the new contract and deprecate the old contract. The registry keeps track of the address of the current version of the contract. Ideally we plan on leveraging the registry with ENS, so that `cardstack.eth` will resolve to the address of the most current version of the CST contract.
